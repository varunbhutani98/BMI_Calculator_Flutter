# What is Body Mass Index (BMI)?
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a calculation of body fat on the basis of height and weight applying to adult men and women. Your Body Mass Index score tells you about whether you are underweight or overweight.

# What does the Body Mass Index mean?
The Body Mass Index informs you about your weight that you have and if it is right or not. You are allotted a BMI Score.
Based on the score that you get, you may be advised to bulk up or lose weight. It is done to ensure that you maintain a bodyweight that may be good to maintain it for functioning and keeping diseases off normally.


# Formula And Calculations 

Formula: weight (kg) / [height (m)]2

The formula for BMI is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. If height has been measured in centimeters, divide by 100 to convert this to meters.
